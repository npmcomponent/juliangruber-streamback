streamback
==========

Turn repeatedly called callbacks into streams. Pass a streamback!

Installation
------------

```bash
$ component install juliangruber/streamback
# or
$ npm install streamback
```

Usage
-----

```javascript
var Streamback = require('streamback');

var articleStream = Streamback();
api.subscribe('article', articleStream.feed()); // gets called on every new article

articleStream.pipe(process.stdout);
```

Api
---

### Streamback()

Returns a `streamback` stream.

### Streamback#feed()

Returns a function to be passed as callback. If multiple arguments are passed to this, they are combined to an array.

### Streamback#stop(), Streamback#start()

When stopped, passed in data is dropped.

### Streamback#pause(), Streamback#resume()

Work as expected. Thanks, [pause-stream](https://github.com/dominictarr/pause-stream) :)

Tests
-----

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm test
```
